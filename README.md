# WebQuest: Transform Your Browsing into an Adventure

> Turn your everyday browsing sessions into a dynamic, gamified learning experience.

## Note for Humans

This project is partially an experiment to see what OpenAI's Codex can do when given minimal instructions.
The README (and most all of the code) is generated by Codex, and I'm not sure how much of it will be technically correct.

## Project Summary

WebQuest is a browser extension that gamifies web browsing and learning by treating each web page as a quest. Users earn experience points (XP), unlock achievements, collect loot, and level up as they explore articles, watch tutorials, or complete mini-quizzes. AI-powered summarization and flashcard generation deepen comprehension and retention, turning passive browsing into an active adventure.

## Goals and Objectives

- **Engagement**: Make browsing more engaging and rewarding.
- **Learning**: Encourage knowledge retention through quizzes and flashcards.
- **Personalization**: Adapt quest difficulty and rewards to individual users.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Quest Generation**
   - Auto-detect content-rich pages and generate quests (e.g., "Read & Summarize", "Watch & Quiz").
2. **XP & Leveling System**
   - Grant XP for reading time, quiz performance, and other interactions.
3. **AI-Powered Summaries & Quizzes**
   - Integrate with an LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) to auto-generate page summaries and comprehension questions.
4. **Flashcards & Spaced Repetition**
   - Automatically convert summaries into flashcards and manage review schedules.
5. **Achievements & Loot**
   - Offer badges, cosmetic loot, and power-ups for milestones.
6. **Dashboard & Popup UI**
   - Provide real-time stats, quest logs, and progress overview in a slick UI.

## Technical Approach

| Layer              | Technologies                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Extension Core     | WebExtension API (Chrome, Firefox)  |
| UI Framework       | React (or Svelte/Vue)               |
| State Management   | Redux or Zustand                    |
| AI Integration     | OpenAI API / Local Model (optional) |
| Data Storage       | IndexedDB (local) / Cloud Sync      |
| Backend (Optional) | Node.js + Express + WebSocket       |
| Build Tooling      | TypeScript, Webpack/Vite, ESLint    |

**Total Duration:** ~12 weeks

## Milestones

- **MVP Release (Phase 2)**: Basic questing and XP tracking.
- **Alpha Release (Phase 4)**: Core UI with quest log and dashboard.
- **Beta Release (Phase 6)**: AI quizzes, flashcards, and achievements.

## Next Steps

1. Review project plan and adjust scope or timeline.
2. Start Phase 1: finalize user stories and design prototypes.
3. Assign roles, set up project board, and begin development.
